## Description

_\<This assignment prompts us to devise a series of codes using for loops. We also test functions using if statements.\>_

## What I Learned from This

_\<I learned how to define functions as well as test those functions. I also learned to slice strings. I attempted to learn the uses of tuple and zip.\>_

## Honor Pledge

I pledge that all the work in this repository is my own with only the following exceptions:

* Content of starter files supplied by the instructor;
* Code borrowed from another source, documented with correct attribution in the code and summarized here.

Signed,
